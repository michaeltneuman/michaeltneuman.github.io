        <h2>Day 5: Views</h2>
        <p>Sadly, we could not stay in Dublin any longer. But alas, there was an entire Irish countryside we had to explore. On our way to the car rental, our cab driver Mick told us a little about Irish culture and things we needed to know. He spoke with such a thick Irish accent and often mumbled off the ends of his setences until saying "you know?" and you just have to nod along. Well you don't have to, but we did cause he was talking way too quickly. My sister was a little nervous about driving on the left side of the road. Mick said, "Yea, but the toughest part is getting used to the accelerator being on the left." After a few awkward seconds of confusion and fear in my sister's eyes, he smiled and giggled at his own joke. Every single one of our interactions with the local folks was a story of its own.</p>
        <p><i>HOLY SHIT!</i> That is pretty much the thought that crossed my mind upon arrival at Sally Gap in the Wicklow mountains. Such a beautiful view, definitely a great place to camp. We just pulled over on the side of the road and walked around for a bit, taking in the amazing views. When I gaze down at the select few houses and barns in the gap, I think about how completely different these people's lives are from my own. These people are sheep herders with one electrical line that controls power for the entire area. I'm sitting here typing this on a two monitor computer probably consuming as much electricity in a day as these people do in a year. It's just fascinating.</p>

                <figcaption>Sheep were painted with various colors (red, green, blue), we guessed for the owners to distinguish whose sheep is whose? But then some of them had multiple colors. Maybe there are some sheep farmer disputes. Or we're completely wrong.</figcaption>

        <p>After stopping for some views, we continued driving through the Southeast countryside. A few things: the roads are NARROW. This made driving so stressful because only one car could really fit on the road at a time (locals will tell you otherwise). So some bridges we crossed we had to make sure no one was coming the other way before zooming across. With increased stress, we took a longer time to drive, but that allowed us to take in all the beautiful scenary. There's one thing that I quickly found out about the Irish countryside: SHEEP! Sheep are EVERYWHERE! Like seriously, there were some in the middle of the fucking road that we were nervous we were going to hit. Anyways, after driving for a while, we did some more hiking and sightseeing around Glendalough which has a very cool old monastic settlement. The cemetaries were filled with very stereotypical Irish names: Murphy, O'Donovan, O'Sullivan, O'Reilly, McCarthy, you get the picture. In case you didn't know, the "O" and "Mc/Mac" in translates to descendant or son. So McDonald's is like a restaurant owned by Donald's son. After doing more sightseeing, we finally arrived at Cobh, a smaller town on the Southern coast with plenty of history. Stay tuned!</p>
