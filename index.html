    <h1>Searching for the pot of gold</h1>
    <p>The past couple of weeks I had the great fortune of being able to travel to the land of some of my ancestors, Ireland, the Emerald Isle. I traveled along with my entire immediate family which hasn't been possible for many years due to conflicting schedules and such.

    <h2>Day 6</h2>
    <p>Happy 4th of July! Being in Ireland to celebrate the United States anniversary of independence wasn't as filled with fireworks as every single one of my friends' snap stories but... <a href="day6.html">(click here to read more)</a></p>
