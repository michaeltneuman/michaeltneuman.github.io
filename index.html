    <h1>Searching for the pot of gold</h1>
    <p>The past couple of weeks I had the great fortune of being able to travel to the land of some of my ancestors, Ireland, the Emerald Isle. I traveled along with my entire immediate family which hasn't been possible for many years due to conflicting schedules and such. It was also the first time I have left the continent of North America (I've been to many states in the US and went to Niagara Falls when I was much younger) so I was pretty excited. Here's a summary of the things that I experienced, enjoyed, hated and learned throughout my travels!</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <h2>DAY 1: TRAVELING TO DUBLIN</h2>
            <p>When I was younger, I would always have a more difficult time getting through security at airports because I had to carry along my diabetes supplies. Bringing needles and a little device (my insulin pump) attached to your body that look like bombs usually raises some TSA alarms. Even nowadays I'll sometimes have to go through some extra screening process (usually just a brief extra patdown along with testing my fingers and the insulin pump for bomb residue) to ensure that I'm not a bad guy. On this trip, however, I didn't get stopped at all which decreased the likelihood of us being late for our flight.</p>

            </div>
            <p>We first flew into Toronto to transfer to a separate flight to Dublin. Once we arrived, everyone in my family and apparently in the entire Toronto airport wanted to grab dinner. This poor lady making paninis at one of the stands was struggling to keep up with the long line. And of course at an airport, everyone's in a hurry and impatient. So this poor lady is getting mildly harrassed by irritated customers who aren't getting their food quickly enough. And the lines never stopped growing, more and more people showed up. I don't know, I just kind of feel bad for employees at airports. All the people they interact with are on tight schedules and are flying elsewhere so that they never interact with the employee ever again. This probably leads to a little more rudeness and dissatisfaction which just sucks. Our flight was delayed for a few minutes but I knew that was a small problem compared to what that poor lady had to deal with for the next few hours. And then again the next day. And so on.</p>
            <p>Anyways, ranting aside, our flight overseas from Toronto to Dublin Airport was flown by two pilots who claimed to have over 70 years combined of flying experience! This made me feel a little more comfortable and safe for traveling through the air. On the plane, I watched a couple of episodes of Band of Brothers. One of them contained scenes of planes being shot down out of the sky in the days leading up to D-Day. This made me feel a little less comfortable and unsafe for traveling through the air. Sleeping on planes is difficult. Especially if there is a woman on the plane speaking in a full volume conversation with the passenger next to her about Carrie Underwood for the entire flight. But everybody's got their flying story, I'm just glad to <a href="https://youtu.be/q8LaT5Iiwo4?t=120">partake in the miracle of human flight.</a></p>

            <h2>Day 2: Figuring Out Dublin</h2>
            <p>The first thing I noticed once leaving the airport in Dublin: everybody's on the LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD. Now growing up I had always assumed that the United States and Canada were kind of alone in the right-side driving group. However, we discovered that most of the world does indeed drive on the right side of the road.</p>

                <figcaption>Green = Drive on Right Side of Road<br>Orange = Drive on Left Side of Road</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We took a bus from the airport to our hotel. The first thing I noticed about Ireland was its different architecture. We were told to get off at the O'Connell Bridge as that was the closest stop to our hotel. What we didn't know was that it was about a half mile walk. So the whole Neuman clan trekked through the streets of Dublin with all of our luggage, trying to figure out if the different side of the road driving also translated to a different side of the sidewalk you were supposed to walk on. I botched bad and knocked over a stranger's bike. When trying to pick it up and fix it, I accidently dropped my way too top-heavy suitcase. Things weren't going too well for Michael but we made it to the hotel just fine.</p>
            <p>We first went and got our 'breakfast' at around one o'clock in the afternoon followed by walking around aimlessly. I saw a restaurant called Eddie Rocket's which just looked like a Johnny Rocket's ripoff. Maybe they're brothers, not sure. This was when I first noticed the type of music that was played in Ireland. Generally, music fell into one of three main categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_traditional_music">Traditional Irish Tunes (trad music)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nsKDJlpUbA">UK Garage/House music (Disclosure galore)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8">Outdated American Pop Music (songs from Middle School and High School)</a></li>
                </ol>

            </figure>
            <p>We briefly stopped by Dublin Castle and learned about the unsolved theft case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Crown_Jewels">Irish Crown Jewels</a> and the successful escape of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Roe_O%27Donnell#Early_life.2C_imprisonment.2C_and_escape">Red Hugh O'Donnell</a> along the brothers Art and Henry O'Neill. They were the only prisoners to ever escape this crazy castle. Maybe it makes me a little weird but I like learning random pieces of information such as this. We didn't stay long cause we were too exhausted from travel. At the hotel, my sister and I watched Sabrina the Teenage Witch for a little while. I don't think I have ever seen the show before but in this episode, she accidently gave her principal some of her magic powers. I didn't get to catch the end of it but I hope all is well with Sabrina.</p>

            <p>People in Ireland are so friendly! We went to <a href="http://thehairylemon.ie/">The Hairy Lemon Pub</a> where the waiters joked around with us and brought us drinks while we ate tasty pub food and listened to "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy. Serving, tipping and paying for meals in Ireland works differently than in the United States. At most places, it didn't seem like we had one specific server assigned to our table but rather the entire wait staff was there for your service. A 10-12% tip is pretty standard for a meal (or at least I was told that, who knows, I could've made a lot of people bitter). If you want to pay with a card, they bring a card machine to the table to scan yours in and then the waiters themselves put in the tip amount you tell them to.</p>
            <p>Afterwards we returned to the hotel where the American tunes continued, this time courtesy of the hotel piano man. He actually played "Piano Man" by Billy Joel and then some other hits (that song from La La Land, Get Lucky by Daft Punk, Starlight by Muse). Overall, the first day in Dublin was not so much sight seeing as it was learning how to behave correctly (and minimize looking too much like a tourist).</p>
