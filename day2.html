        <h2>Day 2: Figuring Out Dublin</h2>
        <p>The first thing I noticed once leaving the airport in Dublin: everybody's on the LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD. Now growing up I had always assumed that the United States and Canada were kind of alone in the right-side driving group. However, we discovered that most of the world does indeed drive on the right side of the road.</p>

        <p>We took a bus from the airport to our hotel. The first thing I noticed about Ireland was its different architecture. We were told to get off at the O'Connell Bridge as that was the closest stop to our hotel. What we didn't know was that it was about a half mile walk. So the whole Neuman clan trekked through the streets of Dublin with all of our luggage, trying to figure out if the different side of the road driving also translated to a different side of the sidewalk you were supposed to walk on. I botched bad and knocked over a stranger's bike. When trying to pick it up and fix it, I accidently dropped my way too top-heavy suitcase. Things weren't going too well for Michael but we made it to the hotel just fine.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">We first went and got our 'breakfast' at around one o'clock in the afternoon followed by walking around aimlessly. I saw a restaurant called Eddie Rocket's which just looked like a Johnny Rocket's ripoff. Maybe they're brothers, not sure. This was when I first noticed the type of music that was played in Ireland. Generally, music fell into one of three main categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_traditional_music">Traditional Irish Tunes (trad music)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nsKDJlpUbA">UK Garage/House music (Disclosure galore)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8">Outdated American Pop Music (songs from Middle/High School)</a></li>
            </ol>

        <p>We briefly stopped by Dublin Castle and learned about the unsolved theft case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Crown_Jewels">Irish Crown Jewels</a> and the successful escape of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Roe_O%27Donnell#Early_life.2C_imprisonment.2C_and_escape">Red Hugh O'Donnell</a> along the brothers Art and Henry O'Neill. They were the only prisoners to ever escape this crazy castle. Maybe it makes me a little weird but I like learning random pieces of information such as this. We didn't stay long cause we were too exhausted from travel. At the hotel, my sister and I watched Sabrina the Teenage Witch for a little while. I don't think I have ever seen the show before but in this episode, she accidently gave her principal some of her magic powers. I didn't get to catch the end of it but I hope all is well with Sabrina.</p>
        <p>People in Ireland are so <b>friendly!</b> We went to <a href="http://thehairylemon.ie/">The Hairy Lemon Pub</a> where the waiters joked around with us and brought us drinks while we ate tasty pub food and listened to "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy. Serving, tipping and paying for meals in Ireland works differently than in the United States. At most places, it didn't seem like we had one specific server assigned to our table but rather the entire wait staff was there for your service. A 10-12% tip is pretty standard for a meal (or at least I was told that, who knows, I could've made a lot of people bitter). If you want to pay with a card, they bring a card machine to the table to scan yours in and then the waiters themselves put in the tip amount you tell them to.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we returned to the hotel where the American tunes continued, this time courtesy of the hotel piano man. He actually played "Piano Man" by Billy Joel and then some other hits (that song from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkD10lhMMrg">La La Land (spoiler alert)</a>, Get Lucky by Daft Punk, Starlight by Muse). Overall, the first day in Dublin was not so much sight seeing as it was learning how to behave correctly (and minimize looking too much like a tourist).</p>
