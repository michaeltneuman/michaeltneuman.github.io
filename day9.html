        <p>Dingle. It's a funny name. We spent our 9th day journeying around the Dingle peninsula and catching all of the sites. Dingle's main attraction is to go and see the Dingle dolphin. The dolphin's name? Fungie. Fungie the Dingle Dolphin. Imagine telling someone else your plans, "We're going to drive 150 kilometers west and then are planning on catching Fungie, the Dingle dolphin." I don't know, I probably just have the sense of humor of a 5 year old. Anyways, we didn't even actually see the dolphin cause it didn't fit with our schedule. Instead, we drove around and hiked along the cliffs on the waterfront. It's such a cliche but you need to go there to truly experience it.</p>

        <p>After doing some hiking on the waterfront, we drove to Mt. Brandon which is supposedly Ireland's tallest mountain. Standing at a whooping 952 meter elevation, Mt. Brandon is...wait actually, let's stop there. Ireland's tallest mountain is just over half a mile tall. Not that tall at all haha. Anyways, Mt. Brandon is named as such because Saint Brendan climbed to the top of it and claimed to be able to see America. We  joked that Brandon was granted sainthood on false pretenses. At the foot of the mountain, there were nuns who just spoke to everyone who walked by. My sister and I didn't make it all the way to the top (as we were on a tight schedule) but we still got some amazing views.</p>
        <p>After an amazing dinner at a place recommended by the cottage owners. Oh wait! The cottage owners. Okay, so we were lucky to be staying at the <a href="http://lochlein.com/">Loch Lein Country House Hotel</a> with our gracious hosts. Since it was Friday night and we were journeying into the city, they entrusted us with the keys to the cottage since they assumed (rightfully) that they would be asleep before our return. The hosts also hooked us up with a very nice dinner spot in town that had super tasty food. After devouring our dinner, we went out briefly to a bar called "the Shire". This place was my Lord of the Rings wet dream, they even had three different kinds of ale: Bilbo's Beer, Frodo's Lager and Gandalf's Ale. Of course, what was our topic of discussion with the bartender? Game of Thrones. After drinking one too many Frodo beers, we returned to the cottage where my Day 10 hangover awaited my sleeping ass.</p>
