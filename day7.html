        <p>On our last full day in Cobh, we journeyed a few hundred meters across the water to explore Spike Island, a prison that was actual open up until 2004. We took a tour boat over with many other tourists from America and Ireland. There was this one Irish baby who was just hilarious, disobeying his mother and marching around the island pretending to be a guard. <a href="http://classickids.com/">Classic kids</a>, am I right? We learned about how prisoners rioted on the roofs. My brother remarked that it was a kind of dumb idea since they're kind of stuck up there. Which makes sense. But it did get national attention and this prison eventually closed. The design of the prison was actually pretty clever. They were worried about being attacked so they built a moat around the fort but didn't fill it up with water so that if you wanted entry to the fort or wanted to leave the fort, you would have to climb all the way up the moat. There was an escape attempt that involved a human pyramid but it ultimately failed.</p>
        <p>I went on a run while in Cobh. One thing about Ireland: not many runners. When I was in Dublin, I went on an early morning run and was getting very puzzling looks. In Cobh, even more confused looks like <i>where is this person running from?</i> I guess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6nFhcI4tgI">jogging</a> isn't an Irish thing?</p>
        <p>While eating our dinner along the waterfront, we noticed a cameraman setting up on the balcony of the restaurant where we were eating. At first we were unsure what the deal was, we just assumed they were taking pictures of the scenary or something? Anyways, we went on a little boardwalk walk and upon returning, we see a huge crowd of people all crowded around the waterfront. Supposedly this boat called <b>THUNDER CHILD</b> was attempting to break a speed record for going around the entire country. It zoomed by with this other boat spraying water behind it. I was very confused but then everyone started cheering and clapping so I started cheering and clapping. The boat was even on the <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/thunder-child-sets-new-world-record-for-long-way-around-irish-voyage-796562.html">Irish news</a> that evening.</p>
        <p>One final thing that was super interesting to learn about was the port in Cobh. The port of Cobh was supposedly the last port of call for the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/">TITANIC</a> before some bad things happened. The port was also the starting point for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Moore_(immigrant)">Annie Moore</a>, the first immigrant to the United States to pass through inspection at Ellis Island. Even this tiny town has an enormous amount of history!</p>
