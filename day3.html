        <p>On Saturday morning, we took a tour of Trinity College, Ireland's oldest university which was founded way back in 1592. We took a guided tour around campus led by an undergraduate student who was very well versed in the history of the school. We learned about many of the school's interesting and repressive policies that used to be enacted. For instance, their old Provost George Salmon resisted allowing women into the university up until his death in 1904. There's a statue dedicated to him on the front lawn of Trinity College that is often defaced and mocked. Trinity College is sister universities with the University of California Berkeley. It is actually supposed to be pronounced Barkley (think Irish accent) like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jov6UlUW7ws">this guy</a>. We then went into the Trinity library where all the books are written in Latin.</p>
        <p>A few more random things I noticed that were different from the United States. A lot more people here smoke cigarettes, its just more accepted. Many places only have espresso machines, so no drip coffee. I was a cappuccino man, had to resist the urge to become hooked on <a href="https://youtu.be/VV-M69LLn5s?t=289">cafe lattes</a>. After touring the college, we walked around Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green, two parks in the city.</p>

        <p>There was a pro life rally going on near Merrion Square and they were like screaming on their megaphones and had this ginormous stage setup but only like 20 people showed up even though there were posters all around the city advertising it. We then walked down Embassy row trying to guess which countries the flags belonged to. For dinner in the evening we went to a very tasty restaurant called <a href="http://www.fadestreetsocial.com/">Fade Street Social</a>. Food was wonderful and the servers even offered us tips on things to do in the city! Following dinner, we walked around the city and saw some street performers play more classic American songs. By classic I mean shitty 2000s acoustic pop covers. But people were loving it and they drew huge crowds so I guess more power to them, ya know?</p>
        <p>My brother and I concluded the night by going out on the town to see what Ireland was really all about. We met two Northern Irishmen outside of a bar who had heard of Chicago, specifically the Blackhawks. We tried to get them to explain the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling">Hurling</a> to us as it is all the rage in Ireland. A fast paced mix of lacrosse and handball, by the end of the trip, I loved watching. They also questioned why us Americans are so obssesed with guns and we tried to explain some people's thought process behind the 2nd amendment but they generally thought that our gun crazy culture is...well a little too crazy. No comment. We took whiskey shots with a bartender, spilled Guinness in a bar that was fully carpeted for some reason (smells?) and then topped the night off with eating McDonald's in the fancy hotel lounge at 3am. We were immediately identified as tourists because we didn't know what the Big Tasty is. I still don't know what it is but I think I know two adjectives that describe it.</p>
