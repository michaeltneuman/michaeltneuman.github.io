        <p>Happy 4th of July! Being in Ireland to celebrate the United States anniversary of independence (even though we actually declared on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)">July 2nd</a>) wasn't as filled with fireworks as every single one of my friends' snap stories but it was still enjoyable! Our first destination was the Rock of Cashel or(otherwise known as St. Patrick's Rock). Our tour guide told us about how the Scully's Cross, which was supposedly the largest and most famous cross in Cashel, got struck by lightning in 1976. He then made a <i>Back to the Future</i> reference about it being 1985 but nobody got the joke. Anyways, this place was super interesting and we learned about how many buildings were designed. One thing that impacted me the most was how one of their cathedrals was purposefully constructed to have the arch be aligned not exactly in the center. And it doesn't look nice because we want symmetry, humans find symmetry aesthetically pleasing. But it was purposefully designed because it is a reflection of humanity itself: imperfect.</p>
        <p>After visiting the Rock of Cashel, we journeyed to Mitchelstown where one of my relatives had supposedly resided. When we found the house where my great grandmother had lived, we were disappointed to discover the downstairs shop had turned into a pizza place. Not just any pizza place but this offensive pizza chain called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Pizza">Apache Pizza</a>. It looked like Ireland's version of Papa John's but worst tasting (never thought I'd say that sentence).</p>

        <p>Our day ended going into Cork, one of Ireland's larger cities besides Dublin. Interesting sights: I saw teenagers coming out of a night club blasting Benny Bennassi's "Satisfaction" at 8pm on a Tuesday Night. They were all wearing green Jansport backpacks which was weird. We also saw a flyer for a band who was playing. Their name: "Pontious Pilate and the Naildrivers". Holy shit. I tried fish and chips for the first time in Ireland and I normally don't like any seafood but I started warming up to it after getting this simple but tasty meal. Overall, my 4th of July was much quieter than the one I experience in America.</p>
