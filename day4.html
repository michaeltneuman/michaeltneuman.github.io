        <p>For our last full day in Dublin, we decided to learn a little about the old history of Ireland which mainly consisted of two things: Vikings and Beer. Outside the viking museum we went to called <a href="http://www.dublinia.ie/">Dublinia</a>, they had a short timeline summary of Dublin. One thing that was interesting was to see the different translations of old Viking names as well as learning the origins of certain words and phrases that we still use today. For example, Olaf had a nickname of Olaf the White so his spanish translation said Olaf "El Blanco". Apparently Enrique roughly translates to Henry so someone like Enrique Iglacius would be called Henry Iglacius. The word 'bank' comes from the Italian word 'banco' meaning a bench, where bankers would exchange money and bills. When a banker failed, his bench was broken ("He's gone broke") by the rest of the population and he became 'bankrupt'. They were also playing Lord of the Rings at the Viking Museum so I watched for a while. I mean how can you not?</p>
        <p>We also walked around outside to check out the beautiful Christ Church Cathedral. There was this adorable little girl who kept chasing pigeons around and every two seconds yelling "SHOO!" It was not only the cutest thing ever, it was pretty effective at keeping the pigeons away. We then returned back to our hotel to rest for a little while. One thing that was difficult while out of the United States was to determine what was going on in the news. I accidently bought into this <a href="http://kfl3.com/evanston-il/what-leonardo-dicaprio-is-saying-about-evanston-illinois-residents-11/">fake news article about Leonardo Dicaprio</a>. Also Irish television and radio news is not much better than American television and radio news (more on this later). Radio DJs spent a lot of time talking about Ed Sheeran and his mysterious disappearance from Twitter. Guess celebrity gossip is popular everywhere.</p>
        <p>Following a short rest we embarked to the Guinness Storehouse which is the touristy part of St. James' Gate Brewery founded in 1759. The entire thing is <a href="img/day4/guinnesslayout.JPG">shaped like a giant pint glass</a> which I thought was really clever but a little absurd. I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_(profession)">coopering</a> and also how Guinness is different from other beer makers and that it is infused with Nitrogen. Know that rattle when you shake up a Guinness can? That's a kid's tooth! (sick reference bro) Just kidding, it's a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/plastic-ball-guinness-smoothifier-widget-ads-nitrogen-2015-9">little nitrogen ball</a> that helps give the correct amount of head to the Guinness. Pretty interesting stuff, I recommend for anyone who finds history interesting and/or likes drinking beer. The top of the brewery actually had one of the better views of Dublin.</p>

        <p>To conclude our evening, we went on a Literary pub crawl celebrating Ireland's many great poets and writers like James Joyce and Oscar Wilde, all while drinking pints in pubs. Performers told us about how Dublin alone had 4,500 pubs and that often women would just sell ale right out of their houses. It wasn't until the 17th century that alcohol was taxed and required a license to sell. Now there's <i>only</i> like 800 or so. They had trivia which is always fun. Except when you don't know the answers to any of the questions. Which was this case for me since I know very little about Irish literature. One funny story that was told regarding James Joyce was his answer to the following question: What is the best way to navigate through the city of Dublin <i>without passing a single bar</i>? His answer: Just go in all of them!</p>
