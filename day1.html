        <h2>Day 1: Flying High</h2>
        <p>When I was younger, I would always have a more difficult time getting through security at airports because I had to carry along my diabetes supplies. Bringing needles and a little device (my insulin pump) attached to your body that look like bombs usually raises some TSA alarms. Even nowadays I'll sometimes have to go through some extra screening process (usually just a brief extra patdown along with testing my fingers and the insulin pump for bomb residue) to ensure that I'm not a bad guy. On this trip, however, I didn't get stopped at all which decreased the likelihood of us being late for our flight.</p>

        <p>We first flew into Toronto to transfer to a separate flight to Dublin. Once we arrived, everyone in my family and apparently in the entire Toronto airport wanted to grab dinner. This poor lady making paninis at one of the stands was struggling to keep up with the long line. And of course at an airport, everyone's in a hurry and impatient. So this poor lady is getting mildly harrassed by irritated customers who aren't getting their food quickly enough. And the lines never stopped growing, more and more people showed up. I don't know, I just kind of feel bad for employees at airports. All the people they interact with are on tight schedules and are flying elsewhere so that they never interact with the employee ever again. This probably leads to a little more rudeness and dissatisfaction which just sucks. Our flight was delayed for a few minutes but I knew that was a small problem compared to what that poor lady had to deal with for the next few hours. And then again the next day. And so on.</p>
        <p>Anyways, ranting aside, our flight overseas from Toronto to Dublin Airport was flown by two pilots who claimed to have over 70 years combined of flying experience! This made me feel a little more comfortable and safe for traveling through the air. On the plane, I watched a couple of episodes of Band of Brothers. One of them contained scenes of planes being shot down out of the sky in the days leading up to D-Day. This made me feel a little less comfortable and unsafe for traveling through the air. Sleeping on planes is difficult. Especially if there is a woman on the plane speaking in a full volume conversation with the passenger next to her about Carrie Underwood for the entire flight. But everybody's got their flying story, I'm just glad to <a href="https://youtu.be/q8LaT5Iiwo4?t=120">partake in the miracle of human flight</a>.</p>
